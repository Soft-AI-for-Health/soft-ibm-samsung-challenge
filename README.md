## Short Description
### The Problem
According to the world health organization (WHO), an estimated 322 million people are
dealing with depression. It is also estimated that by 2030 the cost the global crisis will cost
nearly US$ 16 trillion which will be due to direct factors such as healthcare and therapy,
indirect factors such as lost of productivity, social issues etc. The impact if not mediated to can
cause long term harm worldwide. The global pandemic brought about concerns regarding
mental health, including substance abuse as well as suicide ideation. An efficacy of
technological applications and approaches that are focused on mental health challenges need
global centre stage and best applied to help alleviate the detrimental effects of mental health.
Our solution focuses on a psychotherapy app, that has an Artificial Intelligence (AI) feature
that would be used by front – line workers, in their everyday lives.

### How technology can help
Technology allows user to keep track of their mental health and prompt them in taking healthy
corrective decision/actions

- Mental self-improvement – This focuses of elements such as positive affirmations,
breathing techniques, meditation techniques and audio relaxation.

- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy – AI based feature that allows the user to have an
interaction with AI based ‘therapist’ to help user undergo cognitive behavioural therapy.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a form of psychological treatment that has been
demonstrated to be effective for a range of problems including depression, anxiety disorders,
alcohol and drug use problems, marital problems, eating disorders, and severe mental illness.
Numerous research studies suggest that CBT leads to significant improvement in functioning
and quality of life. In many studies, CBT has been demonstrated to be as effective as, or more
effective than, other forms of psychological therapy or psychiatric medications.
CBT therapists emphasize what is going on in the person’s current life, rather than what has
led up to their difficulties, the focus is primarily on moving forward in time to develop more
effective ways of coping with life.
By practicing strategies like these with your therapist — and at home by yourself — you’ll
develop useful skills like:

• gaining awareness of unhelpful thoughts and how they impact your emotional state
• getting a more logical understanding of other people’s actions
• challenging automatic assumptions
• accurately assessing reality
• coping with triggering or upsetting situations
• learning positive self-talk and how to boost confidence
• relaxation techniques

### Innovation
Suggesting the user activities after they record/ and the speech is converted to text using Watson studio.
The application will run on Samsung devices. The application was tested on Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra

## How it Works
![soft architect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51744364/142750392-441c593c-365a-44a0-b4a8-2b00699ec5b1.png)


The Application flow and architecture is as follows:
1. The user opens the application and record what they want to say
2. The application sends the user message to IBM Watson Assistant service,
3. Watson Speech to text processes the audio and extracts the text and displays the
message on the text box (mobile app)
4. Watson assistant is provisioned with Cloud foundry for data
